# String Calculator TDD Kata

This repository contains a solution for the **String Calculator** kata. The goal is to implement a calculator that can handle summing numbers from a string input with various delimiters, as specified by the kata.

The `StringCalculator` can be able to:

1. **add method** can handle any amount of numbers.
2. **add method** can handle new lines between numbers ("1\n2,3" returns 6)
3. **add method** can support different delimiters
3. Calling **add method** with a negative number will throw an exception: "negative numbers not allowed <negative_number>".
